                    Caching uses less bandwidth coming into an institutional network where the client is located, if the cache is also located in that institutional network. Caching generally provides for a faster page load time at the client, if the web cache is in the
                    client’s institutional network, because the page is loaded from the nearby cache rather than from the distant server.

                    HTTP/2 allows a large object to be broken down into smaller pieces, and the transmission of those pieces to be interleaved with transmission other smaller objects, thus preventing a large object from forcing many smaller objects to wait their turn for
                    transmission. HTTP/2 allows objects in a persistent connection to be sent in a client-specified priority order.

                    Consider the pattern of red and green packet arrivals to a router’s output port queue, shown below. Suppose each packet takes one time slot to be transmitted, and can only begin transmission at the beginning of a time slot after its arrival. Indicate
                    the sequence of departing packet numbers (at t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) under FCFS scheduling. Give your answer as 7 ordered digits (each corresponding to the packet number of a departing packet), with a single space between each digit,
